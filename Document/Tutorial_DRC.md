# Tutorial: How to make DRC runset for KLayout 
by jun1okamura

Regardless of the original PDK package from TOKAI RIKA, I would like to remake the DRC runset for the KLayout step-by-step as a Tutorial and ask the Open-Source Silicon community to provide feedback and/or collaborate to polish it. This is my first deep dive into Klayout DRC/LVS and TR-1um technology, so there may be misunderstandings and non-optimized use of the runset command. Please feel free to let me know and guide me to the proper method or command.

I might be one of the first users and chip designers of EWS-based EDA software in Japan. In 1987, I installed the **SDA Edge** tool on a Sun-3 workstation and learned many of the features for designing Dynamic Memory device. Bundled DRC/LVS feature for physical verification, later called **DIVA** after **SDA** acquired and renamed to **Cadence**, we have to develop the runsets for DRC/LVS by desginers themselves, since there was no EDA team at that moment. So, the following method is based on such personal experiences and might not reflect upfront engineering technology driven by commercial EDA tool vendors. It would be much appreciated if I could have that feedback as well.

**IMHO**, I would rather keep the DRC runset simple and readable, and straightforward in its process steps, than prioritize usability as in the P-Cell base approach, for easier maintenance and expandability. Also, I would not care about execution speed, especially at the first stage of the runset development; it would be the next priority and should instead be handled by the tool rather than the runset.

**Then, Let's start!**
